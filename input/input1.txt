Christmas is celebrated on December 25 every year, and it is a cultural festival of the Christian community. It marks the birth of Jesus to Mother Mary. It is said that Jesus was born in a stable and was a good shepherd. The life of Jesus was one of hardships and sacrifices, and Christmas aims to acknowledge that fact. Christmas is a public holiday in all the countries and is celebrated by non-Christians too as it is a festival that integrates people of all cultures. The central theme of Christmas celebrations is to have a spirit of sharing, kindness, and empathy towards one another.
