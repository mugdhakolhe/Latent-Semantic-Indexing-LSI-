Christmas tree decorating is the most fun-filled activity during Christmas. It can be done by putting up beautiful trinkets, bells, and ornaments on the Christmas tree. People exchange gifts, and many parents tell their kids that the imaginary Santa Claus brings gifts for them every year. Children are taught to share and be empathetic towards others by helping each other out in need. The poor and needy, who cannot celebrate Christmas, are assisted, so they wonâ€™t miss such an amazing festival.
